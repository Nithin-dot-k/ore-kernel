## Overview

The Native Candle Engine is ORE's built-in inference backend, powered by Hugging Face's [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) framework. It runs quantized GGUF models directly on CPU, CUDA, or Metal - no Python, no daemon, no external runtime.

## Hardware Detection

On boot, the `NativeDriver` probes for available compute hardware:

```
CUDA available?  → Use CUDA
Metal available? → Use Metal
Neither?         → Fall back to CPU
```

The selected `candle_core::Device` is passed to all model loaders. No manual configuration required.

---

## Model Loading (GGUF)

When an inference request arrives and the model isn't loaded:

1. **Locate the model** - Searches `models/<model_name>/` for `.gguf` files
2. **Instant Boot (`memmap2`)** - Maps the file directly into virtual memory using the OS's `mmap` syscall, achieving sub-50ms boot times by letting the OS lazily stream required weight pages into the GPU instead of stalling system RAM.
3. **Read GGUF metadata** - Extracts architecture type from `general.architecture` field via the memory-mapped cursor without reading the entire file.
4. **Route to loader** - Dispatches to Llama or Qwen2 loader based on architecture.
5. **Store in engine** - The loaded model and its memory-mapped file lock are held as an `ActiveEngine` until evicted.

### `OreEngine` Enum

```rust
pub enum OreEngine {
    Llama(/* architecture-specific model state */),
    Qwen(/* architecture-specific model state */),
}
```

Each variant wraps the architecture-specific model loader and implements a common interface for text generation.

## Tokenizer Resolution (2-Tier)

Finding the right tokenizer is surprisingly hard. The engine uses a cascading resolution strategy:

```
Tier 1: Model-specific tokenizer
        models/<model>/tokenizer.json
        ↓ (not found?)

Tier 2: Extract from GGUF metadata
        Read tokenizer data from .gguf file
        JIT-cache to disk for future loads
```

### Tier 2: GGUF Metadata Extraction

Source: [`ore-core/src/native/gguf_tokenizer.rs`](../../ore-core/src/native/gguf_tokenizer.rs)

Some GGUF files embed tokenizer data in their metadata. The engine extracts this data, constructs a tokenizer JSON, and **caches it to disk** so subsequent loads skip the extraction. This is a JIT (just-in-time) caching strategy - the first load is slow, every load after is instant.

---

## Streaming Token Generation

Tokens are generated one-at-a-time and sent through a `tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender<String>`:

```
Model generates token
     │
     ▼
tx.send(token_text)
     │
     ▼
Handler receives via rx
     │
     ▼
Streamed to client as text/event-stream
```

This enables real-time streaming - the client sees tokens as they're generated, not all at once after completion.

## Native System Embedders

**Source:** [`ore-core/src/native/models/bert.rs`](../../ore-core/src/native/models/bert.rs) | [`ore-core/src/native/models/nomic.rs`](../../ore-core/src/native/models/nomic.rs)

The kernel includes a built-in `SystemEmbedder` abstraction that generates vector embeddings using Safetensor models. Two architectures are supported:

1. **BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)** - The lightweight, ultra-fast default. (Models up to 90MB)
2. **Nomic (`nomic-embed-text-v1.5`)** - High accuracy, custom RoPE/SwiGLU architecture. (Models up to 500MB+)

### Architecture

```
Input Text → Tokenize → Model Forward Pass → Hidden States
     → Masked Mean Pooling → L2 Normalization → Embedding Vector
```

### Key Details

- **Model format:** Safetensors (full-precision weights)
- **Pooling:** Masked mean pooling - averages hidden states across non-padding tokens.
- **Normalization:** Vectors are immediately L2 normalized to unit lengths so the Semantic Bus can use cheap arithmetic dot-products during search.
- **Memory:** Zero-RAM idle design. When the embedding thread completes, Rust's ownership model drops the model and frees all allocated memory.

### The `embedder_lock` (Concurrency Safety)

Because embedder models can require upwards of 500MB of RAM/VRAM to load, parallel Semantic Bus API calls (`POST /ipc/share` or `POST /ipc/search`) could accidentally load the model 10 times simultaneously, blowing past available hardware limits in an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash.

To prevent this, the server handler layer wraps the embedding generation in a strict `Arc<Mutex<()>>` `embedder_lock`.

```rust
let _embedder_guard = state.embedder_lock.lock().await;
// Load model -> Generate -> Drop model
```

This enforces serialization: only **one thread** is allowed to instantiate the embedder weights into memory at a time. Other concurrent agent requests wait safely in an async queue.

### Zero-RAM Idle Design

The embedder model is loaded, used, and dropped within a single function scope. When the computation finishes:

1. The `_embedder_guard` unlocks (allowing the next request to proceed).
2. The model weights are dropped.
3. All intermediate tensors are freed.
4. RAM instantly returns to 0MB idle.

No manual memory management. No garbage collector. The Rust type system enforces it.

## Supported Model Formats

| Format | Type | Models | Pull Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GGUF** | Quantized weights | Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5, etc. | `ore pull llama3.2:1b` |
| **Safetensors** | Full-precision weights | BERT embedders | `ore pull system-embedder` |

### GGUF vs Safetensors

| | GGUF | Safetensors |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Text generation (LLMs) | Embeddings (BERT) |
| **Precision** | Quantized (Q4, Q8, etc.) | Full precision (f32) |
| **Size** | Smaller (quantized) | Larger (full weights) |
| **Metadata** | Includes architecture info, can embed tokenizer | Requires separate config files |
