# API Reference

> All 15 authenticated HTTP routes exposed by the ORE kernel daemon.

**Base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

**Authentication:** Every request requires a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The token is auto-generated on boot and written to `ore-kernel.token`. Unauthorized requests receive `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

## Inference Routes

Source: [`ore-server/src/handlers/inference.rs`](../ore-server/src/handlers/inference.rs)

### `GET /ask/:prompt`

Secured inference with full firewall pipeline + SSD paging. Uses `terminal_user` manifest by default.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ore-kernel.token)" \
     http://127.0.0.1:3000/ask/What%20is%20a%20mutex
```

**Pipeline:** Auth → Manifest lookup → Firewall (injection + PII + boundary) → Page-in history & KV-Cache → Scheduler → Inference → Page-out history & KV-Cache (with Compaction support)

---

### `POST /run`

Streamed inference with rate limiting. Returns tokens as a `text/event-stream`.

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ore-kernel.token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "qwen2.5:0.5b", "prompt": "Explain ownership in Rust"}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:3000/run
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:0.5b",
  "prompt": "Explain ownership in Rust"
}
```

**Response:** `text/event-stream` - tokens streamed in real-time.

## IPC Routes

    "score": 0.98,
    "source_app": "scraper_agent",
    "timestamp": 1711728200
  }
]
```

**Errors:** Returns standard HTTP status codes like `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` if manifest permissions are denied.

### `POST /ipc/send`

Send a direct message from one agent to another via the Message Bus.

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ore-kernel.token)" \
