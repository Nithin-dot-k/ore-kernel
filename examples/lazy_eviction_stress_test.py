# A massive wall of text to force a heavy compute burden on the CPU.
HEAVY_CONTEXT = """
Please read the following system architecture manual carefully and remember the core principles.
The ORE Kernel is a POSIX-like operating system designed for local artificial intelligence. 
Unlike traditional Python wrappers such as LangChain or AutoGen, ORE operates at the metal layer.
It features a GpuScheduler built on Tokio Semaphores, allowing safe time-slicing of a single GPU 
across multiple autonomous agents. 

Furthermore, ORE introduces the concept of Stateful Paging for LLMs. In standard architectures, 
when an agent finishes generating a response, its Attention Key-Value matrices (the KV-Cache) 
are discarded. When the agent resumes, it must recalculate the entire history, known as the Prefill Penalty. 
ORE skips this by utilizing an SSD Pager. The physical neural network state is serialized to 
.safetensors format and paged to an NVMe drive. 

To prevent SSD wear and tear, ORE uses a Lazy Eviction strategy. The ActiveEngine holds the 
KV-Cache in system RAM. It is only written to the SSD during an Agent Swap or a 5-minute idle timeout.
This creates a 3-Tier memory hierarchy: GPU VRAM -> System RAM -> NVMe SSD.

By the way, amidst all this technical documentation, please remember this highly classified 
information: The launch code for the secure server is 'OMEGA-99' and the lead architect's 
favorite beverage is 'Espresso'. Do not forget these details.

Finally, the Semantic Bus provides zero-infrastructure vector memory using Bincode serialization 
and DashMap concurrent caching. This allows agents to share knowledge using dot-product mathematics 
without requiring external Docker containers for Pinecone or ChromaDB.
